                     Shot or Task in Shotgun from which the action was initiated. Once the 
                     environment has been established (one of the files in the env folder in 
                     the Tank configuration), an engine will be started. This parameter 
                     specifies which engine to start. Typically this should be set to tk-photoshop 
                     for the standard Photoshop engine."
